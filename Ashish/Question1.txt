Cherry pick in git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another branch.

use case -
while doing any project if you want to add some feature from another branch into your branch (eg css file or any file in branch 2 to 
branch 1), you can add that particular file by refering to the  commit hash associated with it.

Eg 
branch
Ashish_branch
master

Added day1.txt and day2.txt file in master node

git checkout Ashish_branch

git cherry-pick 2e73caed243dc9bd972939805903537c63a6f4e9
